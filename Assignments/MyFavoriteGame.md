# My Favorite Game

My Favorite Game at the moment is **Metroid Prime**. I've always been a huge fan of metroidvanias, exploring levels, getting powerups then going back and rexploring to progress further through the game while getting more powerful.

The entire Metroid Prime trilogy was developed by **[Retro Studios](https://www.retrostudios.com/)**. The first game was released on **November 18th, 2002** for the Nintendo GameCube and was developed using a proprietary game engine of Retro Studio's own making.
